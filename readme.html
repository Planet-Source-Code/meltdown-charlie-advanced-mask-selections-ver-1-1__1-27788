 This sample code has been given to the development community by Intact Interactive
 software. The code is not finished commercial level stuff so you will find bugs and
 quirks in it I'm sure. Neither is the code a complete application, it is merely a
 testbed for the functionalily being tested!
 So you use this code on an as is basis with no warranty given or implied by Intact
 Interacive. If you are cool with this then go for it, if not, then delete this.

 Also remember that this is not a one way street, I have to survive as a developer
 as well, so obviously I am not giving away all my knowledge. And I would appreciate
 it if you gave me feedback, vote for me at PSC or wherever you found this posted
 and, of course, download the eval versions of my commercial stuff, if you like what
 you see you might even consider buying some of it ...

 A more complete example of this sample source code can be found at

 out as well as our other source code samples ...

It shows how to use CombineRgn() to progressively add to a mask region.<br>
How to use GetRegionData() to implement an undo/redo feature, and generally shows how the use of regions can make the implementation of complex selections possible in VB !<br><br>
